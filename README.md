# SquareUp

How to play Square Up!
  1. Users enter a username and select a color to play in.
  2. The chosen color will customize the game’s visuals.
  3. Randomly generated words will appear in a playing grid.
  4. Players type the words upon seeing them.
  5. If typed correctly and before the opponent, the box in which the word appeared will turn the player’s color.
  6. Players have 1 minute to type as many words and fill as many boxes with their color as possible.
  7. When time is up, the player with more boxes in their color wins!
  * We recommend using fullscreen for the best gaming experience.
