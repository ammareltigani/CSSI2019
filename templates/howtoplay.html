    <h1>How to play Square Up!</h1>
    <h2>1. Users enter a username and select a color to play in.<br>
    2. The chosen color will customize the game’s visuals.<br>
    3. Randomly generated words will appear in a playing grid.<br>
    4. Players type the words upon seeing them.<br>
    5. If typed correctly and before the opponent, the box <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; in which the word appeared will turn the player’s color.<br>
    6. Players have 1 minute to type as many words and fill as <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; many boxes with their color as possible.<br>
    7. When time is up, the player with more boxes in their <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; color wins!</h2>
    <h5>* We recommend using fullscreen for the best gaming experience.</h5>
