    <h1>How to play Square Up!</h1>
    <h2>1. Users enter a username and select a color to play in.<br>
    2. The chosen color will customize the game’s visuals.<br>
    4. Players type the words upon seeing them.<br>
    5. If spelled correctly and typed before their <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; opponent, the box in which the word appeared will turn to <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; the player’s color.<br>
    6. Players have 1 minute to type as many words and fill as <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; many boxes with their color <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp as possible.<br>
    7. When time is up, the player with more boxes in their color <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp wins!</h2>
